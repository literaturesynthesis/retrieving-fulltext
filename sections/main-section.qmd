- WOS, Scopus, OpenAlex do not host full text (PDF) only citations
- Downloading full text is **a stage in itself**
:::

## Two problems

- A **volume** problem: After title/abstract screening, the volume of articles may still be substantial (several hundred or even thousands)

> Finding such a large volume of PDF is an **unusual process** (blacklisting, institution approval, etc.).


- An **access** problem: Full text access is often subject to a fee and institute subscriptions decreased over years

> Major obstacle to completeness of systematic map/review.


<br>


The full text search is often underestimated and rarely mentioned as a step in the review process. However it:

- is very time-consuming
- is indispensable (influence on the final corpus and therefore on the results)
- requires a high degree of rigor (renaming, archiving, linking citations to files, etc.)



## Semi-automatic search

- Zotero search engine

![](images/zotero-searchpdf.png){width=75% fig-align='center'}



## Manual search

- Institution subscriptions
- Search on ResearchGate

- Search on Google
```
filetype: pdf "Low human interest for the most at-risk reef fishes worldwide"
```

<br>

> Check that your retrieve the good article



## Manual search

- Sci-Hub (not so legal, but...)

> Access denied in France (change your DNS)


## Manual search

- Anna's Archive (not so legal, but...)

## Enhance Zotero search engines

- Edit the file located in: `{ Zotero Path }/locate/engines.json` and add:

```
{
	"name": "Sci-Hub DOI",
	"alias": "Sci-Hub DOI",
	"icon": "http://sci-hub.se/favicon.ico",
	"_urlTemplate": "http://sci-hub.se/{z:DOI}",
	"description": "SciHub Lookup",
	"hidden": false,
	"_urlParams": [],
	"_urlNamespaces": {
		"z": "http://www.zotero.org/namespaces/openSearch#"
	},
	"_iconSourceURI": "http://sci-hub.se/favicon.ico"
}
```

## Request full text

- Request full text on ResearchGate
- Contact the corresponding author


## Non-digitized documents

- On-site consultation
- Inter-library loan
- Digitization



## Rigorous follow-up

## Reporting

![](images/fulltext-reporting.png){width=50% fig-align='center'}


## Missing full texts

- Definitely not free
- Not available on Sci-Hub
- No response from authors on ResearchGate
- Not published at all

> Loss of completeness for your map/review => **Limit of the exercise**


## Missing full texts

**How many?**

- As few as possible
- No written EEC/EEJ rule
- < 10%

## Missing full texts

::: {.column width=50%}
- Discuss it as a limitation in the "Limitations of the map/review" section
- Provide as much justification as possible (in-depth research, etc.)
- Include the list of articles concerned as an additional file
